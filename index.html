    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was the Comet Catcher. The Comet Catcher is a marble drop game where participants need to catch a certain amount of marbles to win a prize.</p>

    <p> I chose Digi in semester 2 because I missed out on semester 1 and wanted to learn more about coding. </p>

    <p> We started the process by choosing the game we wanted to play. I was in a team with Beth, and we were deciding between two different games. We landed on a marble drop and started discussing the rules and how we would make it.

      <p> The back of the game would be made out of two big pieces of carboard stuck together. The pins were made out of skewers placed 450 millimetres apart. After building a prototype, we decided to make the boards 19 by 19 skewers.
        
      <p> The backdrop on the board was designed in canva. We used a space theme to tie in with the name Comet Catcher. The image was of stars in space with part of the Earth at the bottom of the backdrop. After designing the backdrop, we uploaded the image to rasturbation to correctly size it. The image was then printed and glued onto the board.   </p>

      <p> After building the board, we needen to build a frame for it to sit on. We used the epro8 kits to build the frame. We built a box with a sloped frame ontop for so the game would be at the right angle and height to be played.</p>
     
      <p> To catch the marbles, we used lego EV3 robots. I downloaded an app on my computer so we could blutooth connect to the robots and create and download the code. It took a while to figure out how to download the code but after many trials and errors, w finally figured out how to download the code onto the EV3  </p>

      <p> When we were testing our game, we found out that the pins were placed to close together for the ping pong balls we origionally planned to use. We tried a range of different balls and eventualt found that marbles would be a good alternitive. Beth was able to get some marbles in time for market day and they worked well with the game.</p>

      <p> Finally market day came and our game was completed and ready for people to play. Beth and I found a nice shady spot on the field. We set up the comet catcher on a table and tested the game. We ended up having to move the table slightly as the ground was not even enough. We tested the game once more and found that the EV3 did not drive straights and we had to quickly run back to the classroom to gather the equipment we needed to build tracks for the EV3. Thankfully the tracks worked and it was time for people to play. </p>

      <p> During market day we had a few customers play our game. Miss Shaw ended up winning a jar of lollies. Many people came close but were a couple marbles short of winning a prize. </p>

      <p> Overall, market day went pretty well. I think if we didn't spend so much time on the prototype, things might have gone more smoothly and we would have been more organized.</p>
