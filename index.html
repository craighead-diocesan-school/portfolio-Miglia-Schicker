    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was the Comet Catcher. The Comet Catcher is a marble drop game where participants need to catch a certain amount of marbles to win a prize.</p>

    <p> We started the process by choosing the game we wanted to play. I was in a team with Beth, and we were deciding between two different games. We landed on a marble drop and started discussing the rules and how we would make it.

      <p> The back of the game would be made out of two big pieces of carboard stuck together. The pins were made out of skewers placed 450 millimetres apart. After building a prototype, we decided to make the boards 19 by 19 skewers.
        
      <p> The backdrop on the board was designed in canva. We used a space theme to tie in with the name Comet Catcher. The image was of stars in space with part of the Earth at the bottom of the backdrop. After designing the backdrop, we uploaded the image to rasturbation to correctly size it. The image was then printed and glued onto the board.   </p>

      <p> After building the board, we needen to build a frame for it to sit on. We used the epro8 kits to build the frame. We built a box with a sloped frame ontop for so the game would be at the right angle and height to be played.</p>
