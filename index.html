    <h2>My Project</h2>
    
    <div class="container">
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was the Comet Catcher. The Comet Catcher is a marble drop game where participants need to catch a certain amount of marbles to win a prize.</p>

    <p> I chose Digi in semester 2 because I missed out on semester 1 and wanted to learn more about coding. This semester we had to code and build carnival games. We started the process by choosing the game we wanted to play. I was in a team with Beth, and we were deciding between two different games. We landed on a marble drop and started discussing the rules and how we would make it.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <img src="image-comet catcher-skewers.jpg">
      <p> The back of the game would be made out of two big pieces of carboard stuck together. The pins were made out of skewers placed 450 millimetres apart. After building a prototype, we decided to make the boards 19 by 19 skewers.</p>

<div class="container">
      <p> The backdrop on the board was designed in canva. We used a space theme to tie in with the name Comet Catcher. The image was of stars in space with part of the Earth at the bottom of the backdrop. After designing the backdrop, we uploaded the image to rasturbation to correctly size it. The image was then printed and glued onto the board.   </p>

      <p> We also designed a poster on canva that contained the name of the game and the prices. The words were a gradient of yellow to orange on a galaxy backround To fill in the empty space, Beth and I added in a planet and a meteorite to match the theme and colour of the poster. </p>

<p> After building the board, we needen to build a frame for it to sit on. We used the epro8 kits to build the frame. The frame had to be built quickly as we had one day before market day. Beth and I built a box with a sloped frame ontop for so the game would be at the right angle and height to be played. It took a couple of trials to find the perfect angle but we found it and made sure it was able to hold the board.</p>

<div class="container">
      <p> To catch the marbles, we used lego EV3 robots. We weren't initially sure what part of the game we would code as the origional plan was to use microbits. When the oppoutunity to use the EV3 came up we decided that we could attatch a basket on the robot so people could use it the catch the marbles.  </p>
      <img src="comet catcher code.png">
      <p> To start coding, I downloaded an app on my computer so we could blutooth connect to the robots and create and download the code. It took a while to figure out how to download the code but after many trials and errors, we finally figured out how to download the code onto the EV3. </p>

      <div class="container">
        <img src="image-comet catcher-ping pong balls.jfif">
<p> When we were testing our game, we found out that the pins were placed to close together for the ping pong balls we origionally planned to use. We tried a range of different balls and eventualt found that marbles would be a good alternitive. Beth was able to get some marbles in time for market day and they worked well with the game.</p>

      <p> Finally market day came and our game was completed and ready for people to play. Beth and I found a nice shady spot on the field. We set up the comet catcher on a table and tested the game. We ended up having to move the table slightly as the ground was not even enough. We tested the game once more and found that the EV3 did not drive straights and we had to quickly run back to the classroom to gather the equipment we needed to build tracks for the EV3. </p>
      <img src="image-comet catcher-prices.png">
      <p> Beth and I luckily had the help of our friend Hannah who help collect the equipment we needed and test out our game before people started arriving. Thankfully our tracks worked and it was time for people to start playing.</p>

      <p> During market day we had many customers play our game. Al lot of people chose to play level three of the game to try win a prize. Miss Shaw ended up winning a jar of lollies. Most people came close, but were a couple marbles short of winning a prize. </p>

      <p> Overall, market day went pretty well. I think if we didn't spend so much time on the prototype, things might have gone more smoothly and we would have been more organized. We made $26.50 on market day but I think we could have made more money if we decided to sell our prizes aswell.</p>

     <p>I really enjoyed the proccess of building and coding this game for market day. Although it was stressfull at times, it was great to see what we created and the result of all our hard work pay off.</p>
