    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was the Comet Catcher. The Comet Catcher is a marble drop game where participants need to catch a certain amount of marbles to win a prize.</p>

    <p> We started the process by choosing the game we wanted to play. I was in a team with Beth and we were deciding between two different games. We landed on a marble drop and started discussing the rules and how we would make it.

      <p> The back of the game would be made out of two big pieces of carboard stuck together. The pins were made out of skewers placed 450 millimetres apart. After building a prototype, we decided to make the boards 19 by 19 skewers. We spent many hours building our marble drop. We had to work quickly as Market Day was in week 8. </p>
